# Introduction

This report uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset to explore factors associated with heart disease.
Specifically, I am aim to:

1. Describe the dataset and its variables.
2. Provide a descriptive table summarizing key variables overall and by disease status.
3. Create figures to visualize distributions and relationships.
4. Briefly interpret the table and figure.


#Table

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr); library(here); library(knitr)
tbl_num <- readr::read_csv(here::here("output","table_numeric_by_hd.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
tbl_sex <- readr::read_csv(here::here("output","table_sex_by_hd.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
knitr::kable(tbl_num, caption = "Numeric summaries by heart disease (mean/sd)")
knitr::kable(tbl_sex, caption = "Sex distribution (%) by heart disease")
```

#Figure

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(here); library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output","fig_chol_age_hd.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output","fig_bp_hd.png"))
```
